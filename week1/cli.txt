1-a) How do I create a hidden file or folder? (for Windows/PowerShell)

    -Type the following command to hide a folder or file:

    attrib +h "Secret Files"

    In the command replace "Secret Files" with the name of your folder or file. 
    Quotation marks are only necessary when there are spaces in the name.

    cd "Secret Files"

    attrib +h /s /d
