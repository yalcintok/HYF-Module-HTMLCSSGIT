1-a) How do I create a hidden file or folder? (for Windows/PowerShell)

    -Type the following command to hide a folder or file:

    attrib +h "Secret Files"

    In the command replace "Secret Files" with the name of your folder or file. 
    Quotation marks are only necessary when there are spaces in the name.

    -If you're trying to hide a folder with files and subfolders, which you also want to keep hidden, 
    then you'll need to use these steps as well.

    While in Command Prompt type the following command to navigate inside the hidden folder and press Enter:

    cd "Secret Files"

    In the command replace "Secret Files" with the name of your hidden folder.

    Type the following command to hide all files and folders inside the hidden folder and press Enter:

    attrib +h /s /d


1-b) How do I display it in the CLI?
    Use the Force parameter: 
    dir -Force
 
 
 
2) How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
   Your command should be: 
   mkdir -p x/y/z 

3) How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
    first message
    second message
    
    echo "your message" >> "your file name"
    
    e.g. 
    echo "Namaste Hola Merhaba" >> .\greetings.txt
    
    if you add just one more than so you remove all message within the file and just put there the last command message.
